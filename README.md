The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to check real-time weather information for any city around the world. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general conditions like sunny, cloudy, or rainy. The app also supports geolocation, allowing users to get weather updates based on their current location.
